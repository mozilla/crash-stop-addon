      <h1>Crash-Stop Help</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>What’s Crash-Stop?</h2>
        <p>Crash-Stop is an information provider (formerly a Firefox extension) for Bugzilla to display crash data and patch information in a bug report</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Crash data is coming from <a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.org">crash-stats</a></li>
          <li>Patch info is coming from <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org">mercurial</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Crash-Stop retrieves crash signatures from the field cf_crash_signature and the patch information are extracted by parsing the comments to retrieve the mercurial urls containing revision hash.</p>
        <p>The only information sent to the server are signatures and pair channel/revisions.</p>
        <p>The official builds are coming from <a href="https://mozilla-services.github.io/buildhub/">buildhub</a> and with a request on <a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.org">crash-stats</a>. Builds are filtered to remove builds with a very low crash volume (sometimes a build is retriggered because errors and so the previous is almost useless/meaningless).</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>How to read the data?</h2>
        <p>Example of what you can see with Crash-Stop on Bugzilla:</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="screenshots/dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
          <img src="screenshots/light.png" alt="" width="800" height="352">
        </picture>
        <p>For each signature appearing in the bug, we’ve data for each affected products (Firefox/FennecAndroid) and release channels (Nightly/Beta/Release/ESR).</p>
        <p>Several information can be found:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The total number of crashes (Crashes row)</li>
          <li>The total number of crashes for different installs (Installs row). This number is useful to help to see the severity of crash:
            <ul>
              <li>1000 crashes for 1 install is not so important</li>
              <li>1000 crashes for 100 installs is pretty bad because the number of affected users is not so high but it means that these users are crashing a lot</li>
              <li>1000 crashes for 1000 installs is very bad...</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The affected platforms (Windows/OS X/Linux/Android) are shown with an icon on the right of the table (there is a tooltip on the icons to show the percentage)</li>
          <li>For a given buildid, if more than 50% of all the crashes have the flag "startup_crash" set to true, the corresponding cell in the row Crashes are in red.</li>
          <li>On the screenshot, some versions are colored in pink and others in green.<br>
            With the revision urls found in comments, we can get the pushdate of the patch and so guess what are the builds containing the patch, so:
            <ul>
              <li>The versions in pink are the ones without the patch</li>
              <li>The versions in green are the ones with the patch</li>
            </ul>
            So here we can see that the patch had a positive effect on the crash numbers and we can guess that it worked.<br>
            If the volume would have been more important on Release or ESR then it’d be the occasion to request maybe an uplift.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What’s the button "Update status flags"?</h2>
        <p>Crash-Stop reads all the status flags to check the ones which should be updated.<br>So in this case, click on the button to see the changes (in red) proposed by Crash-Stop, and submit the changes.</p>
