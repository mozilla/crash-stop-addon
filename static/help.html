    <h1>What's crash-stop ?</h1>
    <p>Crash-stop is an addon for Bugzilla to display crash data and patch information in a bug report
      <ul>
        <li>crash data are coming from <a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.com">crash-stats</a></li>
        <li>patch info are coming from <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org">mercurial</a></li>
      </ul>
      The addon gets crash signatures from the field cf_crash_signature and the patch information are guessed in parsing the comments to look for mercurial urls containing revision hash.<br>
      The only information sent to the server are signatures and pair channel/revisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The official builds are coming from <a href="https://mozilla-services.github.io/buildhub/">buildhub</a> and with a request on <a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.com">crash-stats</a>, the builds are filtered to remove builds with a very low crash volume (sometimes a build is respan because errors and so the previous is almost useless/meaningless).
    </p>
    <h1>How to read the data ?</h1>
    <p>
      Here is an example of what you can see with the addon on Bugzilla:
      <img src="screenshot.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></img>
      For each signature appearing in the bug, we've data for each affected products (Firefox/FennecAndroid) and release channels (nightly/beta/release/esr).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several data here:
      <ul>
        <li>the total number of crashes (Crashes row)</li>
        <li>the total number of crashes for different installs (Installs row). This number is useful to help to see the severity of crash:
          <ul>
            <li>1000 crashes for 1 install is not so important</li>
            <li>1000 crashes for 100 installs is pretty bad because the number of affected users is not so high but it means that these users are crashing a lot</li>
            <li>1000 crashes for 1000 installs is very bad...</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>the affected platforms (Windows/OS X/Linux/Android) are shown with an icon on the right of the table (there is a tooltip on the icons to show the percentage)</li>
        <li>for a given buildid, if more than 50% of all the crashes have the flag "startup_crash" set to true, the corresponding cell in the row Crashes are in red.</li>
        <li>on the screenshot, some versions are colored in pink and others in green.<br>
          With the revision urls found in comments, we can get the pushdate of the patch and so guess what are the builds containing the patch, so:
          <ul>
            <li>the versions in pink are the ones without the patch</li>
            <li>the versions in green are the ones with the patch</li>
          </ul>
          so here we can see that the patch had a positive effect on the crash numbers and we can guess that it worked.<br>
          If the volume would have been more important on release or esr then it'd be the occasion to request maybe an uplift.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>What's the button "Update status flags" ?</h1>
    <p>
      The addon reads all the status flags to check the ones which should be updated.<br>
      So in this case, click on the button to see the changes (in red) proposed by the addon, nothing is done automatically, you've to save the changes by yourself.
    </p>
